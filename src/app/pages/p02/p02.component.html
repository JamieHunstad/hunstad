            <p class="margin-m">A daily Earth imaging application utilizing the NASA “EPIC” API. The EPIC API provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument. This was a personal project I created in my spare time to challenege my skills in Angular!</p>

            <p class="margin-sm">This project came from my desire to work with an API from NASA, my only reason - I thought it'd be FUN! My goal was to create an application within Angular to serve a daily image of the Earth with past search functionality.</p>

            <h3 class="margin-m">Development</h3>
            <p class="margin-sm">At this stage in the process I began to create my project using Angular. I chose Angular because it would allow me to test my skills in the framework. I used the NASA “EPIC” API to display the image. There were two endpoints I was interested in - the date and the image endpoints. The date endpoint would provide JSON data with the image name, while the image endpoint would use that image name to display the image. The user could then specify the date which they would like to see. This was the basis for how the app would function.</p>

            <p class="margin-sm flex-center">Development did not go without it's issues. I found it would be crucial that the app had functionality to notify when an image was not available. The spacecraft does not always take images due to the camera being down. This meant I had to specify in the code that if an image was not found, the alert be presented.</p>

        <section class="mainTemplate-content-wide two-col">
            <p class="margin-xl-bottom flex-center">Having a “Loading” feature also became important. It takes time for the image to load from the API, meaning that users would need feedback to know whether the application was working. To combat this, I added code within the initial API call to display the “Loading” text and removing once the API call is complete.</p>

            <p class="margin-lg">This project was fun challenge of my skills in Angular and API knowledge. The API came with its obstacles but pushed me to find solutions, helping me become a better developer!</p>
